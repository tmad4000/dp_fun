##To run:

Just open index.html

1. ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
2. Visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

For dev:
If you want react dev tools chrome extension: webpack-dev-server => localhost:8080
To auto-recompile on changes: webpack --watch

Notes:
react dev tools in chrome slow it wayy down -- should this be a worry for users who are developers? or does prod mode disable
cursor position on gestalts doesn't work in safari


Can switch between    
```javascript
<ListView />,
// <ListViewSlow1 />,
in src/index.tsx
```

2. Doesn't work:
shouldComponentUpdate
        return !(_.isEqual(nextProps.gestaltInstance, this.props.gestaltInstance))


3. #ux most recently clicked child should come up on top
                //#TODO move to front of array when expanding and deepFixGestaltInstanceIds?
